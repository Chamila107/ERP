Millennial - For All the World ERP

I am building the following modules for all small businesses in the world

1. Budget vs Actuals
The Budget versus Actuals will allow a small business to generate a snapshot of their budgets and actuals and input remaining hours and expense estimates to be analyzed.  It will also allow for comments on each account that is being budgeted.
2. Time and Attendance 
The T&A will track punch in and punch out transactions.  It will allow for lunch meals.  
3. Sales Order
The order management system will allow a user to create an sales order, associate the order to a purchase order - if applicable, generate an invoice and invoice lines, and create a shipping record and shipping lines.  The sales order will start a process to adjust inventory, create a packing list, picking list, and a work order.
4. Labor and Material Analysis
5. Balance Sheet
6. Income Sheet
7. Chart of Accounts
8. Time and Pay Accruals
The T&P will track hours worked, sick, vacation, and off no pay, discipline, tardies, and fmla

12. Invoicing using square
13. Shipments
14. Picking Lists
